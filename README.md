## Project Overview

Bring Me! is a web application built using React as the front-end framework and Node.js as the back-end server. The game allows players to join a global room or play solo to receive riddles and hints. Players can use their webcams to capture images of objects they think fulfill the riddles, and the application will determine if the answer is correct. Players earn points for solving riddles and can compete in the leaderboard to claim their positions.
